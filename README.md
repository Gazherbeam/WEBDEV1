Replace path/to/your/file.cshtml with the actual path and name of the .cshtml file you wish to remove.
The git rm command stages the removal, so a subsequent git commit is necessary to make the change permanent in the repository's history.
If the file has uncommitted changes, Git will prevent git rm to avoid accidental data loss. You may need to commit or stash those changes first, or use the -f (force) option with git rm if you are certain you want to discard the local changes.
